# FSM-adventure-game
This project contains the SystemVerilog implementation of a finite state machine (FSM) adventure game, designed to run on an Altera FPGA Development Board. The project features a modular and hierarchical design, leveraging multiple interconnected modules to handle user input, state transitions, and output displays.
